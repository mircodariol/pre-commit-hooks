"""
disable_periodic_background_checks.py

This script is designed to parse Envelope project files and disable periodic
background checks by setting the value of all BACKGROUND_CHECK nodes to '0'.

Functions:
    _fix_file(filepath: str) -> bool:
        Parses an Envelope project file, looks for all BACKGROUND_CHECK nodes,
        and sets their values to '0' if they are not already '0'.
        Saves the modified Envelope project content back to the file if any
        changes were made.

    main(argv: Sequence[str] | None = None) -> int:
        The entry point of the script. Parses command-line arguments to get a
        list of filenames, processes each file using _fix_file, and prints a
        message if any file was modified.

Usage:
    To use this script, run it from the command line with a list of Envelope
    project filenames as arguments. The script will process each file and
    print a message if any modifications were made.

    Example:
        python disable_periodic_background_checks.py file1.prjx file2.prjx
