"""
erase_vendor_code.py

This script is designed to parse Envelope project files and ensure that no
vendor code secrets are present.
The function looks for and erases the following tags:
- BATCH_CODE
- PATH_VENDOR_CODE
- VENDOR_CODE

Functions:
    _fix_file(filepath: str) -> bool:
        Parses an Envelope project file, and ensures that no vendor code
        secrets are present in the file itself.
        Erases the contents of BATCH_CODE, PATH_VENDOR_CODE, and VENDOR_CODE
        tags if they are found.
        Saves the modified Envelope project content back to the file if any
        changes were made.

    main(argv: Sequence[str] | None = None) -> int:
        The entry point of the script. Parses command-line arguments to get a
        list of filenames, processes each file using _fix_file, and prints a
        message if any file was modified.

Usage:
    To use this script, run it from the command line with a list of Envelope
    project filenames as arguments.
    The script will process each file and print a message if any modifications
    were made.

    Example:
        python erase_vendor_code.py file1.prjx file2.prjx
